# Computational-Physics-Lab-PHY604-
Based on the M.Sc Physics program of Tribhuvan University, I have tried to write all the fortran program which we encounter throughout the syllabus. I strongly recommend to follow "A First Course in Computational Physics" textbook by Paul L. DeVries. All the exercise and formula are adopted from the book. I have tried my best to make easy to understand the code.
